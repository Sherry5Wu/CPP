/**
 * @brief The differences bewteen reference and pointer:
 * 1. Memory Address Handling
 * 	- Pointer stores the address of a variable and can be reassigned.
 *  - Reference is an alias for an existing variable and cannot be changed to
 * 	  refer to another variable.
 * 2. Nullability
 * 	- Pointer can be nullptr (not pointing to anything).
 * 	- Reference cannot be null and must be initialized when declared.
 * 3. Reassignment
 *	- Pointer can be reassigned to another variableâ€™s address.
 *	- Reference always refers to the same variable after initialization.
 * 4. Indirection & Dereferencing
 *  - Pointer requires explicit dereferencing (*) to access the value.
 *  - Reference is accessed like a normal variable.
 * 5. Pointer Arithmetic
 *  - Pointer supports arithmetic (increment, decrement, etc.)
 *  - Reference does not support arithmetic.
 * 6. Use Cases
 *  - Pointers are better when:
 *  		- You need dynamic memory allocation (new, delete).
 *  		- You need to work with data structures like linked lists.
 *  		- You need to pass nullptr to indicate "no object."
 *  - References are better when:
 *      - You want to pass parameters efficiently (pass-by-reference).
 *      - You want to return values from functions without copying.
