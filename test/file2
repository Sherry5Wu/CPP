Whispers of the Wind

The wind whispers through the trees,
A gentle song, a fleeting breeze.
Dancing leaves in golden light,
Softly swaying, taking flight.

Waves embrace the sandy shore,
Echoing tales of days before.
Moonlight paints the sky so wide,
Stars like lanterns, side by side.

Time may rush, the world may change,
Yet natureâ€™s rhythm stays the same.
Listen close, and you will find,
Peace within the passing time.
